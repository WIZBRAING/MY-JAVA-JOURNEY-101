# MY-JAVA-JOURNEY-101

A collection of Java sample answers and exercises I wrote during my journey learning Java using **NetBeans**. This repository serves as a personal reference and a way to share my learning progress with anyone else learning Java.

## 📘 Overview

This repository contains various Java programs and sample solutions that I developed while learning Java. The code covers a broad range of topics, helping me to reinforce key concepts and practice more effectively. Some of the areas included are:

- Variables, data types, and operators  
- Control flow (if/else, loops)  
- Methods / functions  
- Object‑Oriented Programming: classes, inheritance, polymorphism  
- Collections (arrays, `ArrayList`)  
- Exception handling  
- File I/O  

My main goal is both **self-learning** and **sharing** to look back on my growth, and to help others who want simple but working Java examples.
