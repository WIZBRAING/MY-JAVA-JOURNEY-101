# MY-JAVA-JOURNEY-101

Welcome to **MY-JAVA-JOURNEY-101** — a learning repository where I document and build Java projects as part of my journey to becoming a better Java developer.

---

## 🌱 Project Overview

- **Purpose**: This repository tracks my progress as I learn Java — from core concepts to building real-world applications.  
- **Goals**:  
  1. Understand Java fundamentals (OOP, collections, exceptions, etc.).  
  2. Build small projects (console apps, GUI, REST APIs).  
  3. Share code, notes, and exercises publicly for self-review and collaboration.

## 📚 What’s Inside

Here are some of the things you’ll find in this repo:

- `core-concepts/` — Basic Java concepts like classes, inheritance, interfaces, exception handling.  
- `projects/` — Mini-projects that I build to apply what I’ve learned (e.g., a simple CLI tool, a task manager, or a calculator).  
- `utilities/` — Helper classes, utilities, or reusable code.  
- `notes/` — Markdown or text notes explaining tricky concepts, code snippets, or cheat sheets.
